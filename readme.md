Step 1 : We have attached the circuits in raspberry pi as shown in presentation slide


Step 2 : We have coded inside the raspberri pi to send data using get requests to dajngo db
        install all the required modules as mentioned in link
        raspberry pi sending data is defined in "r_pi_code\AdafruitDHT.py"
        Receiving of request is coded in "api_rest"
        
        
Step 3 : all the analysis part code is written in ML folder
